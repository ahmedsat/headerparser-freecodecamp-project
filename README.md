# Request Header Parser Microservice

tihs is a microservice that parses the request header and returns the value of the header.

this is my solution to the [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice) challenge, which is part of freeCodeCamp's [back-end development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) curriculum.
